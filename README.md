Kill Bill Simple Tax Plugin
===========================

This OSGI plugin for the [Kill Bill](http://killbill.io) platform implements a
fixed tax rate that applies to all taxable items of generated invoices.

The typical use case for this plugin is a regulatory requirement for a fixed
[VAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax) rate.


Upcoming improvements
---------------------

1. Implement single-tenant config
2. Implement multi-tenant config
3. Implement cutoff dates for planned tax-rate changes
